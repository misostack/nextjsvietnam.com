## LLM

Let's take a look at these 2 questions and how ChatGPT (LLM) answers those.

> 1st question: What is LLM ?

> 2nd question: What is our company onboarding process ?

What we can see is, in the 1st question, ChatGPT can answer your question, because there are answers in its knowledge base, so it just picks one them and the answer is more precised to your question.

But in the 2nd question, ChatGPT can not answer your question, because there is no information about your company and its internal process.

**So how do we support ChatGPT can answer this question?**

You must provide it with context included your company's internal process.

And that's what we call RAG (retrieval augmented generation) - provide context for LLM to allow it provides more accurate answers.
