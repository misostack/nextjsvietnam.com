## What makes up a software architecture?

Software Architecture of a program or computing system is the structure of structures of the system, which comprise software elements, the externally visible properties of those elements, and the relationships between them.

Nowadays, software development methodologies focus on developing highly adaptive software, can be easily changed over time, resulting in less of a need for rigid, upfront planning. However, software architecture still **consists of early design decisions** that can be **difficult to change** later.

## Software architecture is an abstraction

Software architecture focuses on the **public aspects** of the elements, and how
they interact with each other.

## Software architecture is about the important stuff

Software architecture consists of important design decisions that shape the system.
Some of them are hardest to change. But in modern software development, the architecture should anticipate change, and be designed in such a way to maximize the potential of adapting and evolving to this change. It is called "evolutionary architecture".

## Why is software architecture important?

Sometimes a developer just wants to jump right in and start coding.

Software architecture is a foundation of the software. It has a profound effect on the quality of what is built on top.

Software architecture is a series of decisions. Some earliest decisions come from designing the architecture, and these carry a high degree of importance because they affect the decisions that come after it.

All software system have an architecture even they don't formally document the architecture.

Software architecture provides a number of benefits when done properly, which greatly increase the chances that the software system will success.

## Defining a solution to meet requirements

There are 4 types of requirements:

1. Funtional requirements
2. Non-functional requirements
3. Technical requirements
4. Operational requirements

Each type of requirements must be identified and understood by working closely with stakeholders, domain experts, business analysts, end users.

And a software quality must be identified with the measurable goals of quatity attributes.
