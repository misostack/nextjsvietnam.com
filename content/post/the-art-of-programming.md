Topics to be discussed are anything about concepts in programming

1. [x] Imperative programming vs Declarative programming

Functional Programming is a declarative programming paradigm, in contrast to imperative programming paradigms.

**Declarative programming** is a paradigm describing **WHAT** the program does, without explicitly specifying its control flow.

**Imperative programming** is a paradigm describing **HOW** the program should do something by explicitly specifying each instruction (or statement) step by step, which mutate the program's state.

> Making a chocolate cake

**The imperative way**

- First, turn on the oven to preheat it at 180°C.
- Next, add flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt to a large bowl, then stir the mixture with a paddle.
- Then, add milk, vegetable oil, eggs and vanilla extract to the mixture, and mix together on medium speed until well combined.
- Distribute the cake batter evenly in a large cake pan, then bake it for approx. 30 minutes.
- Remove the pan from the oven with a pot holder, let it cool for 10 minutes.
- Finally, remove the cake from the pan with the tapping method, and frost it evenly with chocolate frosting.

**The declarative way**

- You have to preheat the oven to 180 °C.
- You have to mix dry ingredients in a bowl.
- Once dry ingredients are mixed, you have to add wet ingredients to the mixture, and mix together to form the cake batter.
- Once the oven and batter are ready, you have to put the batter in a pan, then bake it for 30 minutes.
- Once baked, you have to remove the pan from the oven and let it cool for 10 minutes.
- Finally, you have to remove the cake from the pan, and frost it.
