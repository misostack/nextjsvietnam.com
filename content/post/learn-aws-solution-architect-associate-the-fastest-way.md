### Six Pillars of a well-architecture framework

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31009750/285127662-2507af4a-33ea-4e94-9d1b-488679a22a6f.png)

The common pillars when we design a system:

### 1.1.Domain 1. Secure Applications & Architectures

- Design secure access to AWS resources
- Design secure workloads and application
- Determine approriate data security controls

### 1.2.Domain 2. Resillient Architectures

- Design scalable and loosely coupled architectures
- Design highly available and/or fault-tolerant architectures

### 1.3.Domain 3. High Performance Architectures

- Determine high-performing and/or scalable **storage** solutions
- Design high-performing and elastic **compute** solutions
- Determine high-performing **database** solutions
- Determine high-performing and/or scalable **network** architectures
- Determine high-performing **data** _ingestion_ and _transformation_ solutions

### 1.4.Domain 4. Cost Optimized Architectures

- Design cost-optimized storage solutions
- Design cost-optimized compute solutions
- Design cost-optimized database solutions
- Design cost-optimized network architectures

### AWS Freetier vs Sandbox

#### AWS Freetier

- Create your own AWS Free Tier Account
- Full control
- You've responsible for the bills
- ... but you can operate in the free tier and set a billing alarm

#### Sandbox

- AWS account is hosted by a provider
- Limited control
- No clouds billing(no risk)
- Scenario-based challenges

## II.The building blocks of AWS Service Types

- AWS Global Infrastructure
- Compute
- Storage
- Databases
- Network & Content Delivery
- Containers
- Migration & Transfer
- Management and Governance
- Analytics
- Security, Identity & Compliance
- Application Integration
- AWS Cost Management

### 2.1. AWS Global Infrastructure

> Region: a geographical area.

> Availability Zone: Data centers

> Edge Network: endpoints that AWS use for caching content. eg: CloudFront
