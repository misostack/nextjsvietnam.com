## Overview

AWS provide us "The SAA-C03 Exam", if you can pass the exam, you will get this certificate

> AWS Solution Architect - Associate

About the exam:

- **Level** : Associate
- **Length**: 130 minutes
- **Format**: 65 questions
- **Cost** : $150 USD
- **Delivery Method** : Testing center or online
- **Scoring**: scaled score between 100 - 1000. **Minimum passing score** of **720**
- **Question format**: multiple choice, multiple response

The common pillars when we design a system:

### Domain 1. Secure Applications & Architectures

- Design secure access to AWS resources
- Design secure workloads and application
- Determine approriate data security controls

### Domain 2. Resillient Architectures

- Design scalable and loosely coupled architectures
- Design highly available and/or fault-tolerant architectures

### Domain 3. High Performance Architectures

- Determine high-performing and/or scalable **storage** solutions
- Design high-performing and elastic **compute** solutions
- Determine high-performing **database** solutions
- Determine high-performing and/or scalable **network** architectures
- Determine high-performing **data** _ingestion_ and _transformation_ solutions

### Domain 4. Cost Optimized Architectures

- Design cost-optimized storage solutions
- Design cost-optimized compute solutions
- Design cost-optimized database solutions
- Design cost-optimized network architectures

### AWS Freetier vs Sandbox

#### AWS Freetier

- Create your own AWS Free Tier Account
- Full control
- You've responsible for the bills
- ... but you can operate in the free tier and set a billing alarm

#### Sandbox

- AWS account is hosted by a provider
- Limited control
- No clouds billing(no risk)
- Scenario-based challenges
