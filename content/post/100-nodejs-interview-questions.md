## Question 1

In the JavaScript file, write a program to perform a GET request on the route **https://coderbyte.com/api/challenges/json/age-counting** which contains a data key and the value is a string which contains items in the format: key=STRING, age=INTEGER. Your goal is to count how many items exist that have an age equal to 32. Then you should create a write stream to a file called output.txt and the contents should be the key values (from the json) each on a separate line in the order they appeared in the json file (the file should end with a newline character on its own line). Finally, then output the SHA1 hash of the file.

**Example Input**

```json
{
  "data": "key=IAfpK, age=32, key=WNVdi, age=64, key=jp9zt, age=40, key=9snd2, age=32"
}
```

**File Contents (output.txt)**

```txt
IAfpK
9snd2
```

**Example Output**
